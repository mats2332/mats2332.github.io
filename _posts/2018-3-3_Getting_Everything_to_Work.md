This is where I will be updating the progress of my final project.

Today, I created a blank GitHub repo named mats2332.github.io, cloned the Jekyll theme locally, setup my Atom editor environment with .git and other configurations, configured the Jekyll theme along with editing the CNAME file and pushed it up to my GitHub repo, edited the repo settings on GitHub to use a custom domain, updated my DNS records on the hosting platform of the custom domain I wanted to use, and waited until the DNS records updated.  As you can see, I have my github page, mats2332.github.io, using my custom domain, matsuran.com.  Success!

*The default blog post that comes with this theme was created coincidentally exactly 4 years ago on 2014-3-3...anyone want to calculate the odds?
